    <p>But are we missing something here? What are we exchanging for efficiency?</p>

    <p>In many apps, the votes we cast?�X?the likes, the plusses, the stars, the hearts?�X?are actually more related to cute avatars and celebrity status than to the substance of what��s posted. A most brilliant paragraph by some ordinary-looking person can be left outside the Stream, while the silly ramblings of a celebrity gain instant Internet presence.
    And not only do the algorithms behind the Stream equate newness and popularity with importance, they also tend to show us more of what we��ve already liked. These services carefully scan our behaviour and delicately tailor our news feeds with posts, pictures and videos that they think we would most likely want to see.</p>

    Popularity is not wrong in and of itself, but it has its own perils. In a free-market economy, low-quality goods with the wrong prices are doomed to failure. Nobody gets upset when a quiet Brooklyn cafe with bad lattes and rude servers goes out of business. But opinions are not the same as material goods or services. They won��t disappear if they are unpopular or even bad. In fact, history has proven that most big ideas (and many bad ones) have been quite unpopular for a long time, and their marginal status has only strengthened them. Minority views are radicalized when they can��t be expressed and recognized.

    Today the Stream is digital media��s dominant form of organizing information. It��s in every social network and mobile application. Since I gained my freedom, everywhere I turn I see the Stream. I guess it won��t be too long before we see news websites organize their entire content based on the same principles. The prominence of the Stream today doesn��t just make vast chunks of the Internet biased against quality?�X?it also means a deep betrayal to the diversity that the world wide web had originally envisioned.
